# maui-samples

Sample code, from MS documentation, that I am working through (so I can get a taste for how things hang together).

## Sample Projects

The following projects are visible, that relate directly to tutorial documentation that I am following (with some minor modifications here and there).

1. `Maui.QuickStart.Sample` - the initial quick start sample as provided [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?tabs=vswin&pivots=devices-android). Opted to follow the Android-specific guide.
2. `Maui.NoteTaker.Sample` - the extended tutorial as found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/).

***NOTE: Experimental code only.***
